The user must be able to check who looked at his/her profile as well as who “liked” him/her.

    - When someone goes to someone's profile via /api/profiles/:id, they'll need to be authenticated. Because of this, we can extract the logged in user and add them to :id's view history. Same thing for likes but via /api/likes/:id.

The user must have a public “fame rating”.

    - `fame rating` can be based on profile views and likes in relation to time joined. The more views and likes someone has, higher the fame rating. Fame rating will be a fraction (e.g 6.1). Be lienient so that many people have 10s.

The user must be able to easily get a list of suggestions that match his/her profile.

    Need to look at logged in user's preference. If preference is bisexual, return all users. If male, return only males.
    
    - User.find({ gender: all/male/female })

You must cleverly match profiles:
    - Same geographic area as the user.
    - With a maximum of common tags.
    - With a maximum “fame rating”
